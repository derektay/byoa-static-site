# Getting Started with Markdown Blogging

Welcome to your first blog post! This post will demonstrate various Markdown features that you can use in your blog posts.

## Text Formatting

You can make text **bold**, *italic*, or ***both***. You can also add `inline code` using backticks.

## Links and Lists

Here are some useful Markdown resources:
- [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/)
- [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/)
- [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/)

You can also create numbered lists:
1. Write your post in Markdown
2. Save it in the `content/blog` directory
3. Run `npm run build` to generate your site

## Code Blocks

Here's an example of a code block:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet('World');
```

## Blockquotes

> Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents.
> 
> It's simple to learn and widely used in blogging.
